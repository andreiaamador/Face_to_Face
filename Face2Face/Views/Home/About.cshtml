    <p>
        Here you can book meetings with people you dont't know.
        <br></br>
        You can meet people with the same languages interests as you.
        <br></br>
        You have two ways to do that:
        <br></br>
        You can create your own events and invite people to go on them
        <br></br>
        or
        <br></br>
        You can go to one that already exists.
        <br></br>
        After you attend an event you can give your opinion and also rate the people who organize it.
        <br></br>
        Like the others participants can do the same when you organize an event.
        <br></br>
        You can see Face2Face as an excellent opprtunity to improve your language skills.
